/*Note on button click Events:
if we want to interact with game elements inside the 
environment, then we will need to
    1-create a script with the desired functions that will perform a certain action
    2-attach this script to the game object inside the environment
    3-select the button that will interact with this object.
    4-click "Add Component" -> "Event" -> "Trigger Event" and select the event type
    5-add the object you want to interact with and select the proper function from the object script
